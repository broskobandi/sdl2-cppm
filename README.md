# sdl2-cppm
Abstractions for objects and functionalities of SDL2 written using C++23 modules.
## The goal
The goal of the project is to learn about the new c++ modules as well as to provide
a higher level library for SDL2 that integrates better with modular C++ projects.
## Why SDL2?
I chose SDL2 because I have been using it for many years in small games that I wrote in C,
so I am much more familiar with it than SDL3. I'm sure SDL3 is also stable enough 
for such a project to make sense but I'm going to leave that for another developer 
for now.
## Why C++23?
